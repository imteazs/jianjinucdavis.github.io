Hello.

I decided to write down some of my random thoughts.

For a long time, writing my thoughts out is how I understand myself. Through the interaction with the pen and paper, I was able to see that soul searching for light in layers of darkness. As the strugles untangle itself through my pen on the paper, I see clearly what the situation is and what I want out of the situation. It provides a logical way of thinking through many random thoughts.

Now, I take a step further to write these thoughts down in public. Not that everyone will see it, but anyone can see it. It is different.

Why? Why do I decide to open these thoughts and struggles to public? Why do I decide to mix my random technical blog with other random thoughts?

I see a larger struggle, a struggle beyond my own struggles. It is a struggle shared by many of us, kind hard working people. The fact that we all are struggling to live a peaceful life with our families and friends with a sense of security makes me decide to open my thoughts to public. Maybe no one sees it. It'll be the same as me writing on my own notebook. Maybe someone see it and think about it. Maybe we'll talk about it. But as this is a larger struggle, it is beyong solvable on my own. Hopefully writing down the larger struggles will help me understand what situation we are in, and what choices we have collectively.  In what all seems to be chaotic, I'll use knowledge that we've already known to put the situation in perspective.

Maybe I'll do, maybe I won't. After all, it's April Fool's day. The only day in a year when I can say something and not do. But I hope I carry on. Insha'Allah this project brings some thoughts, peace, and order to this world.
