### Problem Description

- Fail logging in mySQL.
- Detail:
	- Under path /Users/Username/Document, typing in `mysql` in bash returns error indicating mySQL configuration files missing.
- Attemps:
	- Installing missing files fails.

### Solution

- Navigating to path where mysql was initially configured. Then type in `mysql`. It worked!


### Thoughts and comments

1. MySQL was set up before and ran successfully. 
2. I just needed to return to how I started mySQL like before.
