Ever since the invention of a light bulb, getting enough sleep has become a struggle. The situation became worse after companies such as Netflix, Facebook and Twitter entered the market. These companies have made their platforms so addictive that it is diffcult turn them off and go to sleep.

Even though loosing sleep in general is bad, however the detrimental effects are far worse in women than for men. A study in 2009 by Miller and colleagues have found that sleep duration affects biomarkers related to cardiovascular diseases in women, but not in men. 

This would not have been a problem if women get enough sleep. As we are all aware, women, especially those who work and have kids, are not getting sleep. Women who work and have kids are constantly balancing their work and family. They have to perform way beyond expectation than their male coworkers to get acknowlegement, while undertaking more than their husbands.  When work and family conflict, both men and women suffer, but women suffer more. In that situation their sleep quality goes down (Lallukka et al., 2010). 

Poor sleep is a source of a lot of health problems, both mentally and physically. We need to better understand how we can get quality sleep, especially for women.
