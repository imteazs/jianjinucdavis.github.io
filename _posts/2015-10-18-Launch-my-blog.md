Finally, my blog is launched, unofficially. I never thought I would built a website, on my own, one day. This is very exciting to me!

Resources on how to build a personal blog like this are widely available online. Both [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/) and [github](https://pages.github.com) have very clear instructions. 

I get this awesome [template](https://mademistakes.com/work/hpstr-jekyll-theme/) from [Michael Rose](a designer whose work touched me greatly). If you are going to use this template, fork it from Github where the most recent updates were posted. It works better than hitting the `Download` button.

Though the process of building this website, most problems are quite easily solved by googling it.

BTW, for someone who's not from CS background, you'll need to buy a domain name from Namecheap or likewise company and configuring an A record with your DNS provider. Note, an **A Record** is not a record. I'm not kidding. I didn't know...

Here starts the journey!

In my next post, I'll show how to visualize map data.
